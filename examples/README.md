Discussion
----------

The IAPWS 1995 formulation provides functions Xâ‰¡X(rho, T).  This presents a challenge, because we often do not know one or both of these variables a priori.

For example, suppose we want to plot Cp(T) at 101.325 kPa.  We can define an array of temperatures associated with the bottom axis.  However, to calculate Cp(rho, T) we need to also know the densities.  This is achieved by solving 

    p(rho, T) - 101.325 kPa = 0

for rho using Newton's method.  An estimate for the density is required, and this can often be obtained using the ideal gas law or saturation densities.
