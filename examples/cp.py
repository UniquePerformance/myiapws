"""Heat capacity of liquid water at normal pressure between 0 and 100 C.

The IAPWS formulation allows us to calculate cp(rho, T).  However, we want
to plot cp(p=101.325 kPa, T).  This requires we first determine the density
(rho) that solves p(rho, T) = 101.325 kPa.  The optimization is done using
Newton's method.
